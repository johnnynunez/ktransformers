The question asks if any members of the band \"Manson,\" who are named after Charles Manson, have exceeded his kill count.\n\nThe band \"Manson\" mentioned here is likely a reference to Marilyn Manson, an American rock band formed by Brian Warner (known mononymously as Marilyn Manson) in 1989. The band's name is a combination of Marilyn Monroe's first name and Charles Manson's last name, reflecting the band's interest in shock rock and the macabre.\n\nMarilyn Manson, the band, has never been involved in any violent crimes or murders. The band's music and performances are known for their controversial and often dark themes, but they have never been associated with any acts of violence that would result in a kill count exceeding Charles Manson's.\n\nCharles Manson, on the other hand, was directly involved in the planning and execution of the Tate-LaBianca murders, which resulted in the deaths of seven people. His involvement in these crimes is well-documented and has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries.\n\nIn conclusion, no members of the band Marilyn Manson have exceeded Charles Manson's kill count, as the band has never been involved in any violent crimes. The band's name is a reference to Charles Manson, but their activities have been limited to music and performance art. So the answer is no."}

Starch is a complex carbohydrate found in many foods, including potatoes, grains, and legumes. When starch is consumed, it is broken down into glucose in the digestive system. However, the human body regulates the amount of glucose that is absorbed into the bloodstream, so consuming starch does not directly cause hyperglycemia. In fact, consuming starch can help regulate blood sugar levels because it provides a slow and steady release of glucose into the bloodstream, which can help prevent spikes in blood sugar.\n\nA wheelbarrow full of starch would not be able to kill someone with hyperglycemia. However, if someone with hyperglycemia were to consume a large amount of starch, it could potentially cause a temporary increase in their blood sugar levels. However, this would not be enough to cause death, as the body has mechanisms to regulate blood sugar levels and prevent dangerous spikes.\n\nIn summary, a wheelbarrow full of starch would not be able to kill someone with hyperglycemia. However, consuming a large amount of starch could potentially cause a temporary increase in blood sugar levels, which could be managed with proper medical care. So the answer is no."}
