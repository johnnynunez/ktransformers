So, the amount of water in the orange drink is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters.\n\nIn the pineapple drink, there are 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 liters.\n\nNow, we need to account for the spilled orange drink. Since one liter of the orange drink was spilled, we need to subtract the water content of that one liter from the total water content of the orange drink.

His salary increased by 40%:\n\nAdrien's new salary = 40,000 + 0.4 * 40,000 = 40,000 + 16,000 = $56,000\n\nSince Lylah's salary also increased simultaneously, we need to find her new salary. We don't know the exact percentage, but we can assume it's the same as Adrien's increase (40%) for simplicity:\n\nLylah's new salary = 30,769.23 + 0.4 * 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = $43,076.92\n\nNow, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:\n\nTotal salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = $99,076.92\n\nThe answer is $99,076.92."}

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$. Now, we can calculate the total cost: 4 watermelons * 45$ each = 180$, 20 peppers * 15$ each = 300$, and 10 oranges * 40$ each = 400$. Adding these together, we get 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the hospital pays 200 hours * $150 = $30,000. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so they receive 200 hours * $200 = $40,000.\n\nFinally, we need to find the profit. The hospital makes $40,000 from the patients and pays $30,000 to the doctors. So the profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000. The answer is $10,000."}

{"idx": 175, "completion": "To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first determine the total cost of making the lemonade and then subtract the profit. The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which is $3 + $2 = $5. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue from selling the lemonade is 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10. The profit is $25, so the total revenue is $25 + $5 (cost) = $30. Since they made $30 in total revenue, and the cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 30 / 5 = 6 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 6 gallons is 6 * $3 = $18. The answer is $18."}

To find the percentage more they are making now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts and divide it by the original amount: (1100 - 1000) / 1000 = 100 / 1000 = 0.1. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.1 * 100 = 10%. The answer is 10%."}

In total, he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours on boating and swimming.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time he spent on watching shows. He watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.\n\nNow, we know that watching shows was 30% of the time he spent. So, 6 hours is 30% of the total time. To find the total time, we can set up a proportion: 6 hours / 30% = x hours / 100%. Cross-multiplying, we get 6 * 100 = 30x. Solving for x, we get x = (6 * 100) / 30 = 20 hours.\n\nNow that we know the total time John spent on vacation, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing. Sightseeing was 40% of the total time, so he spent 20 hours * 40% = 20 * 0.4 = 8 hours sightseeing. The answer is 8."}

{"idx": 357, "completion": "Morgan's budget is $90. She wants to play mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf costs $5, so she will spend $5 on that. The go-karts cost $10 per ride, so for two rides, she will spend 2 * $10 = $20. She also wants $5 in arcade tokens. So in total, she will spend $5 + $20 + $5 = $30 on herself. This leaves her with $90 - $30 = $60 to spend on her friends. Each friend will also need to play mini-golf and ride the go-karts twice, which will cost them $5 + $20 = $25. So Morgan can invite $60 / $25 = 2.4 friends. Since she can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends. The answer is 2."}

{"idx": 882, "completion": "First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the bacon costs $10 for 5 packs, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, each pack of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. With 6 packs of chicken, the total cost is 6 * $4 = $24.\n\nNext, we need to find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and there are 3 packs, so the total cost is 3 * $4 = $12.\n\nNow, we need to find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. With 7 packs of apples, the total cost is 7 * $2 = $14.\n\nFinally, we need to add up the costs of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.\n\nSince Kelly's budget is $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

Substituting C in the first equation, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18. Dividing by 2, we find that S = 9.\n\nNow that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find the number of eggs Camden painted by substituting S in the equation C = S + 12. So, C = 9 + 12 = 21.\n\nWe also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Since A = M, we can rewrite this as 2A + C + S = 56. Substituting the known values of C and S, we get 2A + 21 + 9 = 56.

{"idx": 1215, "completion": "First, we need to find the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base, so the area of the base is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the jelly beans. Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the volume of the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of jelly beans. Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans.\n\nTim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he guesses there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.3 = 864 red jelly beans.\n\nThe true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off his guess was, we subtract his guess from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36. The answer is 36."}
