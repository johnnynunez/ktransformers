This means that for the last 10 years, she will receive an additional amount each year. The value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000. The additional amount she becomes entitled to is 5% of this value per year, which is $1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000/year. Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year (regular pension) + $50,000/year (additional amount) = $100,000/year. The answer is $100000."}

{"idx": 175, "completion": "First, we need to determine the total cost of making the lemonade. We know that they spent $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for each gallon. So, the cost for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total revenue from selling the lemonade. We know that they sold each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue for each gallon is $0.50 x 20 = $10.\n\nThe profit is the revenue minus the cost. We know that they made $25 in profit. So, the cost is the revenue minus the profit, which is $10 - $25 = $-15. However, the cost cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our calculation.\n\nThe mistake is that we assumed that the cost of lemons and sugar is the same for each gallon, but in reality, the cost of lemons is only $3 per gallon, not $5. So, the cost for each gallon is $3 for lemons + $2 for sugar = $5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit per gallon, which is the revenue minus the cost. The revenue per gallon is $10 and the cost per gallon is $5, so the profit per gallon is $10 - $5 = $5.\n\nTo find out how many gallons they made, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon. The total profit is $25 and the profit per gallon is $5, so they made $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.\n\nFinally, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon. The number of gallons is 5 and the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so they spent 5 x $3 = $15 on lemons.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{15}$. The answer is 15."}

According to the problem, 4x - 5 equals the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting, and 3(4x - 5) equals the number of customers kicked out for physical violence. The total number of customers kicked out is 50. So, we have the equation: x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50. Simplifying this equation, we get: x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50, which simplifies to 17x - 20 = 50. Solving for x, we get: 17x = 50 + 20 = 70, so x = 70 / 17 = 4.118. Since the number of customers cannot be a decimal, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 4. So, 4 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4*4 - 5 = 11. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3*11 = 33.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 6-inch remora is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long. Therefore, two 6-inch remoras would be 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot long in total.\n\nThe combined length of the remoras is 1 foot, and the length of the shark is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100%:\n\n(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%\n\nSo, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The answer is 10."}

Adding these all up, Colby has a total of 40 + 12 + 14 + 0.15 = 66.15 nickels. Since the gumballs cost a nickel each, Colby can buy 66.15 gumballs. However, since he can't buy a fraction of a gumball, he can only buy 66 gumballs. The answer is 66."}

We are given that M = 5, E = 8, and the total number of students in the class is 20. We are asked to find the number of students who are good at math, which is M + B.\n\nWe know that the total number of students is the sum of those who are good at math only, those who are good at English only, and those who are good at both. So, we have:\n\nM + E + B = 20\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n5 + 8 + B = 20\n\nSolving for B, we find:\n\nB = 20 - 5 - 8 = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English. Since we are asked for the number of students who are good at math, we need to add the number of students who are good at math only (M) to the number of students who are good at both (B):\n\nNumber of students who are good at math = M + B = 5 + 7 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 students who are good at math.

{"idx": 1133, "completion": "Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain rate, which we'll call R, and 1 mile on the sidewalk at a rate of 2R.  Since she walks 3 total miles in 40 minutes, and 40 minutes is spent on the beach, we know that 2 miles at rate R and 1 mile at rate 2R takes 40 minutes.  Since rate is distance over time, we can say that 2 miles at rate R is equivalent to 2/R = time, and 1 mile at rate 2R is equivalent to 1/(2R) = time.  Adding these together, we know that 2/R + 1/(2R) = 40 minutes.  Getting a common denominator, we can say that 4R/2R + 1/(2R) = 40 minutes.  Combining like terms, we can say that 4R/2R + 1/(2R) = 40 minutes.  This simplifies to 4R + 1/2R = 40 minutes.  Multiplying by 2R, we see that 8R^2 + 1 = 80R.  Subtracting 80R from both sides, we see that 8R^2 - 80R + 1 = 0.  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which states that R = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a.  In this case, a = 8, b = -80, and c = 1.  Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we see that R = (80 +/- sqrt((-80)^2 - 4(8)(1)))/(2 * 8).  Simplifying, we see that R = (80 +/- sqrt(6400 - 32))/16.  Simplifying the square root, we see that R = (80 +/- sqrt(6368))/16.  Taking the square root, we see that R = (80 +/- 79.8)/16.  Since the rate cannot be negative, we can say that R = (80 + 79.8)/16 = 159.8/16 = 9.9875 miles/minute.  Since Grandma walks"}

{"idx": 1297, "completion": "To make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey. The cost of the passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12, the cost of the jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12, and the cost of the honey is 2 * $10 = $20. So the total cost to make 1 jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. He sells each jar for $50, so his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6. If he sells 10 jars, his total profit is 10 * $6 = $60. The answer is 60."}
{"idx": 1298, "completion": "The total amount of money in the jar is the sum of the value of each type of coin. The value of each type of coin is the number of coins times the value of each coin. The value of each quarter is $0.25, the value of each dime is $0.10, the value of each nickel is $0.05, and the value of each penny is $0.01. So, the total value of the quarters is 32 * 0.25 = $8. The total value of the dimes is 95 * 0.10 = $9.5. The total value of the nickels is 120 * 0.05 = $6. The total value of the pennies is 750 * 0.01 = $7.5. Adding these values together, the total value of the coins in the jar is $8 + $9.5 + $6 + $7.5 = $27. The answer is 27."}
