Both pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had B + 4 * 4 = B + 16 gallons, and the small pool had S + 4 * 4 = S + 16 gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so B + 16 = 2 * (S + 16). Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so B = 4 * S.

{"idx": 416, "completion": "Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that each camel and dromedary has one head, so C + D = 180. We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, so 2C + D = 304. To find the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the first equation from the second: (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180, which simplifies to C = 124. Now, plug C back into the first equation: 124 + D = 180, so D = 180 - 124 = 56. The answer is 56."}

The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue ones, so G = 1.01B. The total number of jelly beans is R + B + G = 4500. Substituting the expressions for R and G, we get 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500. Combining like terms, we have 3B = 4500, so B = 1500. Now, we can find R and G: R = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485, and G = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515. The difference between green and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30. The answer is 30."}

However, since you can't have half a cup, this suggests that the initial setup might not account for the remaining cups used for cinnamon tea. Given that she uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and the total is 27, the cups used in the rows are 27 - 15 = 12. So, 12 cups are divided into 3 rows, meaning each row has 4 cups. Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint, there are 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row. The answer is 2."}

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100, so (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. Simplifying, we get 4J + 20 = 100. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives 4J = 80.

For the other 50% chance, the normal teacher comes in. There's a 40% chance the whole class gets an extension, so Marcus won't have to turn it in. That's 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2 or 20% of the total probability. For the remaining 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30% of the total probability, the teacher doesn't give a class extension, but there's a 20% chance Marcus can get a personal extension. So, 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6% of the total probability is that Marcus gets a personal extension and doesn't have to turn it in. The total probability that Marcus doesn't have to turn in the homework is 50% (substitute) + 20% (class extension) + 6% (personal extension) = 76%.

{"idx": 1302, "completion": "Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. Half of 12 is 6. So 6 toys would be sold for 5 dollars each, which is 6 * 5 = 30. The other 6 would be sold for 7 dollars each, which is 6 * 7 = 42. So in total, he would earn 30 + 42 = 72. The answer is 72."}
{"idx": 1303, "completion": "The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so he digs 6 * 14 = 84 holes. Then, each day, Nate fills in 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 more, so the net change is -3 holes per day. It will take 84 / 3 = 28 days to fill in all the holes. 28 days is 4 weeks. The answer is 4."}
{"idx": 1304, "completion": "Norman High School enrolls 4000 students. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many, so 3/4 * 4000 = 3000. The difference is 4000 - 3000 = 1000. The answer is 1000."}
{"idx": 1305, "completion": "The Adams family has made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. So they have made 2595 + 3075 = 5670 non-chocolate chip cookies. They have made 7995 cookies in total, so they have made 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies. The answer is 2325."}
{"idx": 1306, "completion": "Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7, but lost some on the way. The total number of items he placed on the lab bench was 29. So, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - (29 - 8 - 16) = 7 - 5 = 2. The answer is 2."}
{"idx": 1307, "completion": "James is putting together 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 legs. Each leg needs 2 screws, so he needs 16 x 2 = 32 screws. He has 40 screws, so he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over. The answer is 8."}
{"idx": 1308, "completion": "There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many, so 2 * 10 = 20. The total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30. The answer is 30."}
{"idx": 1309, "completion": "Alexandra raised 430. Kim raised 320 more, so 430 + 320 = 750. Sarah raised 300. Maryam raised 400 more, so 300 + 400 = 700. In total, they raised 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180. The answer is 2180."}
{"idx": 1310, "completion": "Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes, so he ran 1 mile in 4 minutes. Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so she took 4 * 8 = 32 minutes. The answer is 32."}
{"idx": 1311, "completion": "The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There is 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet. The answer is 594."}
{"idx": 1312, "completion": "Each night, the restaurant gets 6 reservations. Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so 2 * 5 = $10 per reservation. They also order a $5 bottle of wine, so each reservation spends 10 + 5 = $15. So each night they make 6 * 15 = $90. They are open 2 days a week, so they make 90 * 2 = $180 per week. The answer is 180."}
{"idx": 1313, "completion": "The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost per watermelon was 80 / 50 = 1.6. He sold them at a 25% profit, so the selling price per watermelon was 1.6 * 1.25 = 2. The answer is 2."}
{"idx": 1314, "completion": "James is twice as old as Dora, who will be 12 in 3 years. So Dora is currently 9, and James is 18. John was 19 when James was born, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8. The answer is 8."}
{"idx": 1315, "completion": "Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she peels 60 / 4 = 15 oranges. So Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane. The answer is 5."}
{"idx": 1316, "completion": "The radiator was 80% off, so he paid 20% of $400, which is 0.2 * 400 = 80. The mechanic charged 3 * 50 = 150. So in total he paid 80 + 150 = 230. The answer is 230."}
{"idx": 1317, "completion": "Let's assume all 20 animals are cows. Then there would be 20 * 4 = 80 legs. But there are only 70 legs, so there must be 80 - 70 = 10 legs missing. Each chicken has 2 legs, so the number of chickens is 10 / 2 = 5. The answer is 5."}
{"idx": 1318, "completion": "There are 4 people sharing 7 pizzas. Each pizza is 8 slices, so there are 7 x 8 = 56 slices total. If they share the pizzas equally, each person can have 56 / 4 = 14 slices. The answer is 14."}
