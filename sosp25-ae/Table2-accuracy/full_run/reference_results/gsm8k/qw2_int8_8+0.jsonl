Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500/year. The answer is $52500."}

This means that before the ants took the last fry, there were 6 fries.\n\nNext, we know that a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Since there were 6 fries before the raccoon stole some, and it stole two thirds, it means the raccoon stole 4 fries, leaving 2 fries.\n\nBefore the pigeons ate their share, there were 5 fries. Each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of 9 fries. However, this is not possible because there were only 5 fries before they ate, so we need to adjust our understanding. The pigeons must have eaten fries after the raccoon stole some, not from the original total. So, we can ignore the pigeons' action for now and focus on the raccoon's action.\n\nBefore the seagull ate its share, there were 6 fries. The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate half of that, which is 7 fries. This means before the seagull ate, there were 13 fries.\n\nFinally, before Dave ate his share, there were 13 fries. Dave ate 14 fries, which is not possible because it would mean there were negative fries before he ate. This indicates that Dave must have eaten fries after the seagull stole some, not from the original total. So, we can ignore Dave's action for now and focus on the seagull's action.\n\nSo, when Dave bought the pack, there were 13 fries in the pack. The answer is 13."}

According to the problem, 4x - 5 equals the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting, and 3(4x - 5) equals the number of customers kicked out for physical violence. The total number of customers kicked out is 50. So we have the equation: x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50. Simplifying the equation gives: x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50, which simplifies to 17x - 20 = 50. Solving for x gives: 17x = 50 + 20 = 70, so x = 70 / 17 = 4.118 (rounded to three decimal places). The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4 * 4.118 - 5 = 11.454 (rounded to three decimal places). The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3 * 11.454 = 34.362 (rounded to three decimal places). The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 4.118 - 11.454 - 34.362 = 0.066 (rounded to three decimal places). The answer is: 0.066"}

{"idx": 606, "completion": "First, we need to find out how many rotations happen in one mile. We do this by dividing the number of rotations in 2 miles (725) by 2, which gives us 362.5 rotations per mile. Then, we multiply this by the number of miles Jeremy drives in a month (400) to find out how many rotations happen in a month. This gives us 362.5 * 400 = 145,000 rotations per month. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many months it takes for the tire to undergo 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations (10,440,000) by the number of rotations per month (145,000), which gives us 72 months. \n\nFinally, we need to convert months to years. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide the number of months (72) by 12 to find out how many years it takes for the tire to undergo 10,440,000 rotations. This gives us 72 / 12 = 6 years.

The total cost of the kiwis is 2 * 1 = 2. The total cost of the apples is 5 * .75 = 3.75. The total cost of all the fruit he has bought so far is 1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25. He started with $10, so he has 10 - 9.25 = .75 left. Plums cost $.25 each, so he can buy .75 / .25 = 3 plums. The answer is 3."}

{"idx": 1075, "completion": "Jenny bought 15 roses. The florist sells a dozen roses for $15, so a single rose costs $15 / 12 = $1.25. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she spent 15 * $1.25 = $18.75. She arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. The florist only has quarters for change, so we need to find out how many quarters are in $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

This means that 40 minutes is equal to 2R miles at a rate of R, or 20 minutes is equal to 1R mile at a rate of R. Since Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a rate of 2R, and we know that 20 minutes is equal to 1R mile at a rate of R, we can say that 40 minutes is equal to 2R miles at a rate of R, or 40 minutes is equal to 1 mile at a rate of 2R.

{"idx": 1310, "completion": "Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa's time for each mile was V, then Aaron's time for each mile was V/2. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran twice as far as Vanessa, we can set up the equation 2*(V/2) = 16 to find the time it took Vanessa to run one mile. Solving for V, we get V = 16. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, her total time was 4*V = 4*16 = 64 minutes. The answer is 64."}

I will use substitution. From the first equation, we can express x as x = 20 - y. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2(20 - y) + 4y = 70. Simplifying this, we get 40 - 2y + 4y = 70, which simplifies to 2y = 30, or y = 15. Substituting y = 15 into the first equation, we get x = 20 - 15 = 5. So there are 5 chickens on the farm.
