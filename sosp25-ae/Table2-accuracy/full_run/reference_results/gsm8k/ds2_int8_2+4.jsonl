{"idx": 62, "completion": "Marcy's initial annual pension is $50,000. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. So, for the last 10 years (30 - 20 = 10), she gets an additional 5% of $50,000 per year. 5% of $50,000 is 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500. So, for the last 10 years, she gets an additional $2,500 per year. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 + ($2,500 * 10) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000. The answer is $75,000."}

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the hospital's revenue is 200 hours * $200 = $40,000. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

He watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows. This was 30% of the time he spent, so 6 hours is 30% of the total time. To find the total time, we can set up a proportion: 6 hours / 30% = x hours / 100%. Cross-multiplying gives us 6 * 100 = 30x, so 600 = 30x. Dividing both sides by 30 gives us x = 20 hours. So, John spent 20 hours in total on his vacation. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 40% of 20 hours sightseeing. 40% of 20 hours is 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours. The answer is 8."}

{"idx": 357, "completion": "Morgan's budget is $90. She wants to play mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf costs $5, so she and her friends will spend 5 + 5 = $10 on mini-golf. The go-karts cost $10 per ride, so twice will be 10 * 2 = $20. Adding the arcade tokens, the total cost for Morgan is 10 + 20 + 5 = $35. Subtracting this from her budget, 90 - 35 = $55 is left for her friends. Each friend will also need to play mini-golf and ride the go-karts twice, which costs 5 + 20 = $25. So, Morgan can invite 55 / 25 = 2.2, but since she can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends. The answer is 2."}

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute this into the equation: A + (A + 20) + D = 45. We also know that B = D + 10, so we can substitute D = B - 10 into the equation: A + (A + 20) + (B - 10) = 45. Since B = A + 20, we can substitute this into the equation: A + (A + 20) + ((A + 20) - 10) = 45. Simplifying, we get: A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45. Combining like terms, we get: 3A + 30 = 45.

The total earnings from small stuffed animals is S * $4, and the total earnings from large stuffed animals is L * $12. The sum of these earnings is $120. So we have the equation: (S * $4) + (L * $12) = $120. Substituting L = 2S, we get: (S * $4) + (2S * $12) = $120. Simplifying, we get: (4S) + (24S) = $120. Combining the terms, we get: 28S = $120. To find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we divide both sides by 28: S = $120 / 28. Simplifying, we get: S = 4.2857.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: (x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19. Simplifying, we get 2x + 4 + x/2 = 19. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get 4x + 8 + x = 38. Combining like terms, we get 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 6. So, the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, which is 6 + 4 = 10. The answer is 10."}
