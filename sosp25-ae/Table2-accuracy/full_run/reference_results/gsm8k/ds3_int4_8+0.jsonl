{"idx": 214, "completion": "Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as S and in the big pool as B. Both pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation: (B + 4 * 4) = 2 * (S + 4 * 4). Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so B = 4 * S. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get (4S + 16) = 2 * (S + 16). Simplifying, 4S + 16 = 2S + 32. Subtracting 2S from both sides gives 2S + 16 = 32. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives 2S = 16, so S = 8. The answer is 8."}

The total number of white fish is now 4 + W, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - W) = 20 - W. The problem states that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so 20 - W = 2 * (4 + W). Simplifying, 20 - W = 8 + 2W. Then 20 - 8 = 3W, so 12 = 3W, and W = 4. The answer is 4."}

In each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, so there are 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row. However, since the number of cups must be a whole number, this suggests that the remaining cups are not part of the rows. The problem states that she uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, which implies that the remaining cups are 15. Therefore, the total cups used in the rows are 27 - 15 = 12 cups. Since there are 3 rows, each row has 12 / 3 = 4 cups. In each row, the cups are equally divided into chamomile and mint tea, so there are 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row. The answer is 2."}

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100, so we can write the equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. Simplifying, we get 4J + 20 = 100. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives 4J = 80. Dividing both sides by 4 gives J = 20. So, John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2*20 + 10 = 50 years old. The answer is 50."}

He was in college for 4 years, so he took out 50k * 4 = 200k in loans. He also lost 25k * 4 = 100k in income from not working while in school. So in total, he needs to earn 200k + 100k = 300k to cover the loans and lost income. At 75k per year, it would take 300k / 75k = 4 years to earn that amount. The answer is 4."}

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00, so the discount is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00, making the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. The total for the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

{"idx": 1168, "completion": "Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. We know that B = Y - 7 and R = 4B. The combined length is Y + B + R = 37. Substituting the expressions for B and R, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37. Simplifying, Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37, which becomes 6Y - 35 = 37. Adding 35 to both sides gives 6Y = 72, so Y = 12. Then, B = 12 - 7 = 5, and R = 4 * 5 = 20. The answer is 20."}

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3C + 75 = 5C + 35. Subtract 3C from both sides: 75 = 2C + 35. Subtract 35 from both sides: 40 = 2C. Divide both sides by 2: C = 20.

{"idx": 1300, "completion": "Josh works 5 days a week (every day except Sunday and Wednesday). He services 3 cars a day, so he services 3 * 5 = 15 cars a week. He gets paid $4 per car, so he makes 15 * 4 = $60 a week. In 2 weeks, he makes 60 * 2 = $120. The answer is 120."}
{"idx": 1301, "completion": "Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 1 of each, so he has 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies left. Then he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, so he has 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies left. He gave away 2 sugar cookies, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies left. Then he baked 4 of each flavor, so he has 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies. In total, he has 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies. The answer is 23."}
{"idx": 1302, "completion": "Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. Half of them is 6. The first 6 would be sold for 5 dollars each, so 6 * 5 = 30. The other 6 would be sold for 7 dollars each, so 6 * 7 = 42. 30 + 42 = 72. The answer is 72."}
{"idx": 1303, "completion": "The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so he digs 6 * 14 = 84 holes. Then, Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more, so the net change is -3 holes per day. To fill 84 holes at 3 per day, it will take 84 / 3 = 28 days. 28 days is 4 weeks. The answer is 4."}
{"idx": 1304, "completion": "Norman High School enrolls 4000 students. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 of 4000, which is 3000. The difference is 4000 - 3000 = 1000. The answer is 1000."}
{"idx": 1305, "completion": "The Adams family has made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. So they have made 2595 + 3075 = 5670 cookies that are not chocolate chip. They have made 7995 cookies in total, so they have made 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies. The answer is 2325."}
{"idx": 1306, "completion": "Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7. So in total, he gathered 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + 7 beakers = 31 items. However, the number of items he placed on the lab bench was 29, which means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers. The answer is 2."}
{"idx": 1307, "completion": "James is putting together 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 legs. Each leg needs 2 screws, so he needs 16 x 2 = 32 screws. He has 40 screws, so he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over. The answer is 8."}
{"idx": 1308, "completion": "There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many, so 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. Together, there are 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. The answer is 30."}
{"idx": 1309, "completion": "Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700. In total, they raised $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2,180. The answer is 2180."}
{"idx": 1310, "completion": "Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes, so he ran at 16 / 4 = 4 minutes per mile. Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa runs at 4 * 2 = 8 minutes per mile. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so she ran 4 * 2 = 8 miles. So Vanessa took 8 * 8 = 64 minutes. The answer is 64."}
{"idx": 1311, "completion": "The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There is 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet. The answer is 594."}
{"idx": 1312, "completion": "Each night, the restaurant gets 6 reservations. Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so 2 * 5 = $10 per reservation. They also order a $5 bottle of wine, so each reservation spends 10 + 5 = $15. So each night they make 6 * 15 = $90. They are open 2 days a week, so they make 90 * 2 = $180 per week. The answer is 180."}
{"idx": 1313, "completion": "The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. A 25% profit means he sold them for 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = $100. So each watermelon was sold for 100 / 50 = $2. The answer is 2."}
{"idx": 1314, "completion": "James is twice as old as Dora, who will be 12 in 3 years. So Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. Therefore, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old. John was 19 when James was born, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old. The answer is 8."}
{"idx": 1315, "completion": "Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she peels 60 / 4 = 15 oranges. Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane in an hour. The answer is 5."}
{"idx": 1316, "completion": "The radiator was originally $400. He got 80% off, so he paid 20% of $400, which is 0.2 * 400 = $80. The mechanic charged 3 hours * $50/hour = $150. So in total he paid $80 + $150 = $230. The answer is 230."}
{"idx": 1317, "completion": "Let's say there are C chickens and K cows. We know that C + K = 20. We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so 2C + 4K = 70. We can solve the first equation for C: C = 20 - K. Then we can substitute that into the second equation: 2(20 - K) + 4K = 70. Simplifying, we get 40 - 2K + 4K = 70. Combining like terms, we get 40 + 2K = 70. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2K = 30. Dividing both sides by 2, we get K = 15. So there are 15 cows and 20 - 15 = 5 chickens. The answer is 5."}
{"idx": 1318, "completion": "There are 4 people sharing 7 pizzas. Each pizza is 8 slices, so there are 7 x 8 = 56 slices total. If they share the pizzas equally, each person can have 56 / 4 = 14 slices. The answer is 14."}
